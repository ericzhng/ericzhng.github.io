Simulation study of wave propagation in structures can provide insights for structural health monitoring system design, developing an efficient simulation toolbox for the purpose thus becomes very essential. This paper addresses the practical issue of simulating guided wave propagation in an infinite domain using non-reflective boundary (NRB) techniques, based on the simulation framework of local interaction simulation approach (LISA) that is currently being developed in our lab.</description>

The acoustic black hole (ABH) effect produces drastic wave compression and energy trapping in thin-walled structures. Recent research has shown that the reflected wave in realistic ABH structures can be reduced by attaching specific wave concentration areas with thin absorbing layer. In this paper, the novel design and implementation of one-dimensional (1D) functionally graded acoustic black hole (FGABH) are presented, as an alternative to achieve low reflection effect.</description>

Recent research has shown that the acoustic black hole (ABH) effect provides wave focalization and dissipation in thin-walled structures. The design and implementation of functionally graded acoustic black hole (FG-ABH) are presented in this work. Two kinds of the FG-ABHs are demonstrated, which are axially graded ABHs and the thickness graded ABHs, respectively. The FG-ABHs are capable to be manufactured by 3D printing tech using the Objet Connex 500 printer.</description>

      <description>Structural health monitoring (SHM) of aerospace structures can ensure aircraft safety and keep maintenance costs down. The purpose of this work is to develop an effective damage characterization framework for identifying various features of damage inside aerospace structures, based on a large data library of damage scenarios generated by the nonlinear guided wave simulation tool UM/LISA. UM/LISA builds the large database of simulation cases with virtually all possible damage scenarios, and then matching pursuit method is adopted to correlate test signals with the database to obtain the information about the damage.</description>

Phased array methods are a promising approach to damage detection by enabling guided wave steering and beam focusing leading to improved localization and sizing of structural damage. Due to the costs and challenges to addressing piezoelectric arrays in parallel, most phased array methods actuate piezoelectric elements one at a time in round-robin fashion with postprocessing algorithms used to synthetically steer and focus the guided waves. In this study, true parallel excitation and sensing of ceramic piezoelectric actuators is implemented in a standard structural health monitoring data acquisition system without requiring highly specialized and expensive ultrasonic data acquisition equipment.</description>

A novel d36-type piezoelectric wafer fabricated from lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) is explored for the generation of in-plane horizontal shear waves in plate structures. The study focuses on the development of a linear phased array (PA) of PMN-PT wafers to improve the damage detection capabilities of a structural health monitoring (SHM) system. An attractive property of in-plane horizontal shear waves is that they are nondispersive yet sensitive to damage.</description>

      <description>Guided Wave is one of the most promising tools for damage detection in the field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), because it can travel long distance without much decay, and is highly sensitive to micro-damage due to its short wavelength. But guided wave is highly dispersive and has infinite number of modes, and is further complicated by the interactions with transducers, boundaries and damage, which renders the modeling of guided wave a rather difficult task.</description>

Local interaction simulation approach (LISA) is a highly parallelizable numerical scheme for guided wave simulation in structural health monitoring (SHM). This paper addresses the issue of simulating wave propagation in unbounded domain through the implementation of non-reflective boundary (NRB) in LISA. In this study, two different categories of NRB, i.e., the non-reflective boundary condition (NRBC) and the absorbing boundary layer (ABL), have been investigated in the parallelized LISA scheme.</description>

CLoVER Transducers are manufactured using the piezoelectric fibers integrated with the interdigitated electrodes with wedge-shaped sectors arranged in a circular way. A coupled-field analytical model was developed based on the piezoelectricity constitutive equations with the consideration of the anisotropic material properties of CLoVER transducers.</description>

      <description>Non-reflective boundary techniques are typically used in simulation to reduce boundary reflections and reduce model size. The non-reflective boundary conditions and boundary layer methods are developed and implemented in UM-LISA to faciliate simulation so that users can focus on the area of interest while avoiding boundary interferences.
The current implementation of NRB techniques implemented in UM-LISA are illustrated below
The following picture shows the performance of different NRB techniques.
